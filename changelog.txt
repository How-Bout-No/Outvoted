First 2.0 alpha! Due to many setbacks and extremely experimental changes this is pushed as an alpha rather than a beta. Also because of said setbacks, models + textures are in a very early state and functionality is kinda just in testing for the time being.

>> Entities <<
@a
- Fully configurable spawn biomes

Wildfire
- Now uses the Minecraft Dungeons texture

Hunger
- Can no longer be moved when burrowed
- No longer makes sounds when burrowed

Kraken
- No longer affects player's oxygen levels, instead just periodically bites down
- Will now clamp down on players after a period of time which attacks rapidly

Meerkat
- Spawns in Deserts in small groups
- Needs to gain trust by feeding it cod or salmon (temporary, will most likely be Termites in future)
- Breedable with same items
- Will guide players to nearby structures or treasures if it is trusting and if you right-click it with a stick (also temporary)

Termite
- TBD
